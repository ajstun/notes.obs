# OBS SETUP (NDI) (2022)
- Tips for maximum performance:
	- Cable Quality:
		- Replaced my old 'cat5, cat5e' cables with quality 'cat7' ones;
	- Decrease the Video quality:
		- My MacBook Pro 2017 seems to be seamless at 1080p outputting a 4K monitor; while the picture is not ideal, im glad i can stream without __any__ hit in performance (after minimizing the 'obs' window at least)

- Troubleshooting your cable:
	- iPerf3:
		- Ran this & found some of my old cables 'Retr' a lot; Replacing & using good cables helped make the 'ndi' experience more 'stable' and 'reliable';
