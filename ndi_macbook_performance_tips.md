# OBS SETUP (NDI) (2022)

- Factors that increased my performance:
	- **Cable Quality**:
		- Replaced my old 'cat5, cat5e' cables with quality 'cat7' ones;
	- **Decreased Video quality**:
		- My MacBook Pro 2017 seems to perform seamlessly at 1080p, from a 4K monitor; while the picture quality is not ideal, im glad i can stream without *any* hit in performance (after minimizing the 'obs' window)

- How i troubleshooted my cable:
	- **iPerf3**:
		- Ran this & found some of my old cables retransmitted('Retr') a lot; Replacing these cables helped make the 'ndi' experience more 'stable' and 'reliable';
